Advent of Code: Solutions
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tedb/advent.svg?branch=2017-nim-rust)](https://travis-ci.org/tedb/advent)

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is like an Advent calendar, but instead of a daily chocolate
 you get to hack on a fun, small programming puzzle, maybe in a new language you want to try out.
 This branch contains solutions to the 2017 puzzles, which I will try to focus on solving with Nim or Rust.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Ted
